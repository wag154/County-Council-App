# <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">Florin Council App</span>

## Description

Our application was built in cooperation with Florin Council, in order to streamline their operations and provide a broad solution to residents in the local area. Through this application users can: register for an account, apply for jobs in the local area, see items in the recycling center to be reused and learn about events in and around Florin.

## App Design and Development

### User Stories

Our project was devised on and managed using Trello. The Trello board can be viewed [here](https://trello.com/b/jrhtUcgq/project). The Trello board was used to plan and forecast tasks as well as provide evidence of progress. The idea for the project was based on our original brief, where the reason for needing a solution was laid out:

* “It is inconceivable to me, that the very institution that honed my cunning, crafty, and clever mind, should now face closure. Staffing the library is becoming increasingly difficult, at the very point when more people are wanting to use our services.”

* “The local recycling centre is overflowing with stuff that can still be reused, Why do people do this? I'm pretty confused.”

* "There is much skill in the local community. Knowledge and crafts have been handed down, generation to generation, but now much of this knowledge is not being shared as regularly, and, as a result, is in danger of being forgotten."
  
* "Florin is surrounded by swathes of beautiful countryside, where many great and legendary historical events have taken place. Unfortunately, much of this is becoming increasingly destitute and our local landscape is becoming unrecognisable."
  

### Wireframes and Design

Wireframes were created to help guide the development of the app. The wireframes were created using Figma and were essential in guiding our design implementation process. The wireframes can be viewed [here](https://www.figma.com/file/AiWZd2D0tZwDRrv3ovDqfB/Untitled?node-id=0-1&t=QGeePVAeYXmr6lM6-0). Though we have diverted from the original designs somewhat, the initial wireframes still provided us with a solid foundation on which to base our final design implementation.


## Features

<span style="color:#428A5B;font-weight:bold">Home Page:</span>

The home page of our application has been kept clean and simple, using a carousel loading data from the events page to quickly show users information about upcoming events.

<span style="color:#428A5B;font-weight:bold">Login / Sign up page:</span>

The login page follows a similar design pattern, allowing users of the application to either sign up for the first time or log back into their account to see data exclusive to them.

<span style="color:#428A5B;font-weight:bold">Jobs Page:</span>

Building on one of the points in the brief, this page contains a list of available jobs in the local area, as well as information about the role and a button to apply for each role.

<span style="color:#428A5B;font-weight:bold">Items Page:</span>

Another point from the brief was around the recycling centre overflowing with potentially useable items. This page allows users of the application to browse a list of those items and inquire about their availability.

<span style="color:#428A5B;font-weight:bold">Events Page:</span>

The final point from the brief was to do with the sharing of information about skills, as well as restoring Florin to a clean environment. This page contains a list of local events such as crafting workshops, as well as events based around recycling and cleaning areas of the town.

## When opening up the application

The application requires the use of node and npm. To install the application locally, clone the repository and run the following commands:

* <span style="color:#428A5B;font-weight:bold">npm install</span>
* <span style="color:#428A5B;font-weight:bold">npm install -d (to install dev dependencies)</span>

## To view the application in your browser

The backend of the application is hosted using render.com so no server is required to start up the app. Instead you just need to <span style="color:#428A5B;font-weight:bold">use the in-built 'Go Live' feature in VS Code</span> to see it running in the browser. Then follow the instructions of the below screenshot, clicking on the client folder in order to access the application using localHost.
